                    I had my interest poking around in computers from a young age, corrupting windows XP by deleting the OS files to get more space for games is my best move yet! And Iâ€™m 21 years old, Pursuing my Computer Science and Engineering Degree in IIIT Naya Raipur. Core computer functionalities always interest me, hence I aim to become a Software Engineer to learn more how things are made and maintained to do such heavy work while proving the users a rich and seamless experience. I have a good grip in Algorithms and Data Structure and enjoy making web applications using Python, Django and Node.js sometimes
